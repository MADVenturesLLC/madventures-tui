# attribution-shape-check.sh — Layer 2 shape-only attribution check for the
# MAD Ventures OS (DEC-20260718-05 clause 19, activated in the same sequence
# as Layer 1 per clause 21).
#
# Pattern: "gate, never edit" (DEC-20260718-02 / path-audit.sh). This script
# reads git state and exits pass/fail. It never modifies anything, and it is
# SHAPE-ONLY: it validates the form of the Attribution block, never whether an
# attested value is true (clause 20 — no truth oracle).
#
# Checks (exactly clause 19 a–c):
#   (a) Branch-prefix check — fail any NEW branch whose name (the path
#       segment after refs/heads/) matches ^(plato|copilot)/ ,
#       CASE-INSENSITIVE. Exempt ONLY if on the pinned historical
#       allowlist below — commit timestamps are contributor-controlled
#       (backdatable) and are never used as authorization
#       (DEC-20260721-01 hardening, 2026-07-21). No intent inference: the
#       prohibition is on the prefixes themselves (clause 5a).
#   (b) Attribution-value check — a Role-Id trailer value must match the
#       enumerated 17-role alternation below, not a permissive pattern.
#       Invented values (operator, boss, founder) are rejected. A commit
#       with no Role-Id but Actor-Id: founder is valid (direct-founder
#       work); Role-Id: founder is invalid.
#   (c) Missing-attribution check — fail when ANY applicable commit (a
#       commit landing role-accountable work under the path filter below)
#       — and the final merged commit on main — lacks a valid Attribution
#       block. Every applicable commit is evaluated independently; the
#       check never passes merely because some other commit carries a
#       block.
#
# PATH FILTER for clause 19(c): `**` — every tracked path in the repository.
# A commit is APPLICABLE if it changes at least one file (non-empty diff;
# for merge commits, the combined diff — a clean merge with no conflict
# resolutions changes no files and is therefore not applicable inside a PR
# range, but the final merged commit on main is always evaluated). In this
# doctrine repository every file-changing commit lands role-accountable
# work unless it is direct-founder work, which the block still records via
# Actor-Id: founder.
#
# Clause 19(a) historical exemption — pinned allowlist (DEC-20260721-01):
# exactly the pre-activation branches that existed when the exemption was
# ruled. Immutable and trusted; extending it requires founder approval of
# a change to this script.

# The seventeen roles ratified before 2026-08-12, plus twelve of the thirteen
# added by DEC-20260812-03 (OA-1 charter ratification, ratified 2026-08-12).
#
# ============================ DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY ============================
# The canonical registry in /04-agents/role-registry.md holds THIRTY roles.
# This list holds TWENTY-NINE. That is not an omission and must not be
# "corrected" by adding the missing role.
#
# `investment-acquisition-lead` is ratified as to its authority boundary but is
# `activation_status: deferred` — non-assignable, non-routable, and ineligible
# for attributed work until a separate explicit Founder activation ruling
# (DEC-20260812-03, Founder ruling 2026-08-12).
#
# Excluding it here is how that invariant is ENFORCED rather than merely
# documented: a commit attributing work to a deferred role fails this required
# check. Restoring it to this list would silently delete the control.
#
# Adding it requires a Founder activation ruling flipping activation_status to
# `active` in the registry. The `selftest` mode carries a negative assertion
# proving the rejection holds; that assertion must be updated in the same
# change, never removed.
# =============================================================================
#
# Otherwise this list MUST stay in sync with the roster summary in
# /04-agents/role-registry.md: a role absent here cannot be used for attributed
# work, because its commits fail this required check.
